This is part of my university's (Universiti Malaysia Sarawak) project, only to serve as an example. You MUST KNOW that I am not a D3 pro.
I'm just experimenting with the new thing k... :D

/* --> I'm really lazy to write my own license, so hence I copy from internet and modified it abit.
      This is the link I visited to copy the  license --> http://dbad-license.org/
      Please don't get irritated by it ;-)

1. Do whatever you like with the original work, just don't be IRRESPONSIBLE .

   Being IRRESPONSIBLE includes - but is not limited to - the following instances:

 1a. Outright copyright infringement - Don't just copy this and change the name.
 1b. Selling the unmodified original with no work done what-so-ever, that's REALLY being an IRRESPONSIBLE programmer.
 1c. Modifying the original work to contain hidden harmful content. That would make you a PROPER IRRESPONSIBLE PROGRAMMER.

2. If you become rich through modifications, related works/services, or supporting the original work,
share the love. Only an IRRESPONSIBLE programmer would make loads off this work and not buy the original work's
creator(s) a pint.

3. Code is provided with no warranty. Using somebody else's code and cursing when it goes wrong makes
you a SUPER DUPER EXTREMELY SUPERBLY UNDENIABLY SO VERY ADUHH REAL IRRESPONSIBLE CREATURE. Fix the problem yourself.
